### Teaching Overview
I view teaching as an extension of my research — a way to make AI more understandable, inclusive, and human-centered.  
My teaching experience spans both **undergraduate and graduate courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, as well as accessibility support roles that ensure equal learning opportunities for all students.
